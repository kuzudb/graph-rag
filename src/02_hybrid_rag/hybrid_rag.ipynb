    "\n",
    "This is similar to the intro Graph RAG pipeline, but with an important difference: the knowledge graph is constructed in *two* stages:\n",
    "- First, the text is preprocessed with an LLM that rewrites the text in simple sentences, so that the entities and relationships are more\n",
    "explicitly represented, and pronouns are replaced with the entities they refer to. This will help the extraction LLM in the second stage by providing a cleaner input.\n",
    "- Next, the entity and relationship extraction stage uses the preprocessed text to explicitly extract the nodes\n",
    "and edges that will represent the graph, as per a specified schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the pipeline is similar to the intro RAG pipeline, where we also store the chunk embeddings of the original text in the vector store. At retrieval time, we retrieve from both the vector store and the graph store, and then combine the results using a Cohere reranker that provides the combined context to the generation LLM.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from this demo, combining graph and vector retrieval can, on average, provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers to the questions. In certain cases, the vector retrieval can retrieve answers that are relevant through the fuzzy relationships that are implicitly modelled via the embeddings. In other cases, the graph retrieval can provide more relevant, complete answers, because it *explicitly* models the relationships between the entities in the text. It's important to note that the two types of retrievals can complement each other, rather than being in competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining vector and graph retrieval and a reranker retriever that can leverage the context from both kinds of retrieval to provide the generation LLM with more relevant and accurate context, and thus a more relevant answer than if either retrieval method was used on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the Graph RAG system can be used to answer a wide range of questions, such as factual questions, definition questions, and reasoning questions. The key is to build a high-quality knowledge graph, and to combine it with vector search in a way that provides the most relevant and accurate answers to the questions."
