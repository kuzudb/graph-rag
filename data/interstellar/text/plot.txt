In 2067, humanity faces extinction due to a global blight. Joseph Cooper, a former NASA test pilot, agrees to pilot NASA's latest mission, to search a distant galaxy for habitable planets. Back home, Cooper's daughter, Murph, insists he stay. Cooper pledges to return, and leaves to join the Endurance team, consisting of scientists Romilly, Doyle, Amelia Brand, and the artificially-intelligent robots, TARS and CASE.

After transiting a newly-formed wormhole near Saturn, the crew arrive at a planetary system, circling a supermassive black hole named Gargantua. Romilly remains aboard, while the others descend into the black hole's gravity well to survey the first candidate planet. The planet is an inhospitable ocean world, and Doyle is swept away by a colossal wave. Cooper and Brand return to the Endurance, but have lost 23 Earth-years due to the severe time dilation, caused by escaping the gravity well. Romilly has aged significantly and the Endurance is depleted of fuel.

On Earth in 2092, an adult Murph helps Professor Brand, Amelia's father, with a gravity equation, supposed to help transport humanity en masse to potentially habitable worlds. On his deathbed, Brand confesses the equation is unsolvable without information from inside a black hole's singularity. Murph wonders if Cooper knowingly abandoned her, but continues Brand's work. She visits her childhood home and comes across her old bookshelf.

The Endurance travels to the second candidate planet, a frigid ice world. They awaken Mann, the surviving NASA explorer in cryostasis, who landed decades ago. Mann attacks them, as he has falsified data to attract rescuers. Romilly is killed, and Cooper, Amelia and the robots, are left with a crippled spaceship, after Mann's failed docking attempt blows out a hatch and kills him. Charting a gravity-assist path around Gargantua, Cooper propels the Endurance towards the final candidate planet, losing 51 years to time dilation. He and TARS sacrifice themselves to lighten the Endurance, so that Amelia may safely reach the final planet.

Falling inside the black hole, Cooper finds a four-dimensional tesseract (a hypercube), made up of infinitely repeated copies of Murph's childhood bedroom, across moments in time. Cooper deduces that a future advanced humankind placed this here, so he may communicate with the past (bootstrap paradox). He and TARS transmit information from within the black hole, through the bookshelf and a wristwatch, enabling Murph to complete Brand's equation. This allows humanity to build space-faring colonies.

The tesseract collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS out of the wormhole, where they are rescued by an O'Neill cylinder colony in the year 2156. Cooper reunites with Murph, now on her deathbed. She tells him to seek out Amelia instead, and he sets off on another mission with TARS. Meanwhile, on the final candidate planet, Amelia removes her helmet, breathing in the air of the new habitable world.
